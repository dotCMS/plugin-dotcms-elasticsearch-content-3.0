This plugin for dotCMS 3.0 exposes native elasticsearch content queries via a viewtool, a java api, a portlet and as a restful service.  It allows you access to geolocation queries, facets, suggestions ("Did you mean?" and other OTB functionality.

This plugin requires the associated fragment to be install to expose the proper packages to OSGi in order to load correctly.
